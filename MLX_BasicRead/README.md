# MLX Sensor 

This is the very basic Arduino code needed to read the MLX infrared temperature sensor. It uses the SMBus protocol, which is compatible with I2C, so it should be easy to port to the Raspberry Pi.

The sensor we have is the [MLX90614ESF-DCI](https://www.melexis.com/-/media/files/documents/datasheets/mlx90614-datasheet-melexis.pdf).
