Images are labelled as Name-blur-distance: blur is the distortion of the heatmap output, while distance is the distance between the person's head and the sensor.

To look at the images, use drawAngleData(filename). Note that there is some distortion because the heatmap is sampled at regular angles, not regular x/y coordinates.
